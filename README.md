## Contributing

* First Step 
_Clone the Repository using git clone ....._

* Adding a new feature
_git checkout -b awesomeFeature_

* Never capitalise first letters. 


### Connecting the Back end to the Front End 

* First Step
_Navigate to the BackEnd Directory and use the command nodemon index.js on the terminal_

* Second Step 
_Navigate to where you extracted the Ngrok File and use the command ./ngrok http: <the port that you selected on the backend> in this case I used the 3000 always have to change the axiox base URL_ 

* Third Step 
_Copy the forwarding port name that ngrok provided to you_

* Fourth Step 
_Paste the name provider into your API file in YOUR FRONT END_

* More Settings (What? Don't know yet).
* Pictures? Like Strava? (Multer {BackEnd} and React Native Image Picker {FrontEnd}, Already done in other apps).
* Graphs! (Mongo Pipeline Aggregations to separate the periods and use Victory Native for the Grapgs, or I could be ambitious and dissect SVG)

#### New Knowledges? 

* Redux (It's amazing and will definitely be implemented in SmartBath V2)
* Working With Maps in RN.
